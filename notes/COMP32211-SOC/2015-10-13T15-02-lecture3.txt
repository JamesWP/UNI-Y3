discussed testing 

V diagram of testing and verification

high level idea has requirements tested by acceptance from consumer

then these are broken down into more granular parts 
  System design -> Integration test



Tests:

  simple, do outputs toggle etc...
  do lines do as required, not undefined etc...
  data in - out

  test random input
  test edge cases, testing all possibilities for data is infeasable

  test state machine, test each state, and probabaly all transitions in
  the system, from what state to what other state and what the trigger for the
  change was

  Test your tests!!!
