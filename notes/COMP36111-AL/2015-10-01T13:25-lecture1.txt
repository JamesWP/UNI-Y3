Graph definition: (for this course):
  -  a pairing of nodes(V) and edges(E)
  -  no self loops
  -  no multiple edges
  -  no directions on edges

Directed Graph definition:
  -  each edge is a link from a to b : (a,b) <- E

Degree of a vertex v definition:
  -  the number of outgoing edges from v

Connected (for undirected graph):
  -  every node can reach any other node in the graph

Connected (for directed graph):
  -  the underlying non directed graph is Connected

Stongly Connected (for directed graph):
  -  each node in the graph can reach every other node

Reachable:
  -  there is a path you can follow, such that you can get from a to b
