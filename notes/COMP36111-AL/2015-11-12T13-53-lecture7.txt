Turing machines
  - Multi tape machine
  - one input tape
  - each tape is infinate but has a starting index 0
  - Alphabet has n symbols and a blank symbol
  - each tape ends at the first blank symbol
  - the last tape is the "output tape"

  M = K, Syg, Q, q0, T

  K > 2 : number of tapes
  Syg : sygma 

  T : set of transitions

  transition:
    if i am in state p and see s- then i write the outputs and transition to new state q

Universal machine

  - is a specal program that will calculate the output of another program M and its input x
  
        U
    M,x -> y

    iff
        M
    x   -> y
